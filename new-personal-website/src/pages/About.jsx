          Hello, my name is <span>Timothy Sung</span>, and I am a student at <span>Georgia</span> <span>Tech</span>.
          My love for computer science stemmed from my interest in video games,
          which started several years ago. Despite my misconception that coding
          would allow me to instantly program any game (and that it would be as
          fun as playing), I continued to pursue software engineering.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
        Now, I develop website applications, from <span>frontend</span> to <span>backend</span>, and I have
        experience in mobile and general program development. I always look for
        new tools and frameworks to use, so I can expand my skillset to eventually
        be able to learn and create anything I want. 
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The latest in my software engineering journey is to develop a nice looking personal website,
          which is this. Last Summer, I worked on <span>algorithms and problem solving</span>, as well as <span>AI</span>, which
          included both learning fundamental mathematical theory and practical application. Now, I am
          diving back into creating practical applications, from start to finish. 
        </p>
        <p>
        For the future, I would love to learn how to create desktop programs or VR/AR applications.
        I looked into Unity with C# a little bit before, so I might dive back into refreshing my knowledge
        on that, as well as dive into Unreal Engine or .NET for more general purpose software.

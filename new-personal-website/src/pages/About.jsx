        Hello, my name is Timothy Sung, and I’m a student at Georgia Tech.
        My love for computer science stemmed from my interest in video games,
        which started several years ago. Despite my misconception that coding
        would allow me to instantly program any game (and that it would be as
        fun as playing), I continued to pursue software engineering.
